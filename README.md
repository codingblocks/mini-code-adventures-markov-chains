# Mini Code Adventures: Mocking data with Markov Chains
Markov Chains are a process that cultivates a statistical model of nodes. These statistics make it easy to generate new data, based on the likelihood of each node following another. The resulting data looks surprisingly realistic, especially if you feed it a lot of data.  People have done a lot of really cool stuff with Markov Chains, and thanks to some nice packages, you can easily do something cool yourself!
